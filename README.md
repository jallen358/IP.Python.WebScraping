# BeautifulSoup and Requests Python Web Scraping

This is an individual passion project that I used as an introduction to Python
and many libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests. The program scrapes
the top 100 fantasy books from the TIME and then uses their titles to scrape 
their ISBNs from a ISBN catalogue. 

### Required Libraries:
- Numpy
- Requests
- CSV
- BS4
